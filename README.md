# 📱 OneTask — SaaS Dark Landing Page

![hero](/src/assets/gifs/hero.gif)

> A **Figma-to-code recreation** of a SaaS landing page built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS** and **Framer Motion**. This project follows a **clean, component based architecture**, **handling prop-based rendering** and **logical layering** between sections and components. 


🌐 **Live Preview:** [OneTask](https://one-task-tau.vercel.app/)

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- **CSS Mask Animations:** Built interactive gradient borders using `useMotionTemplate` and dynamic mask images for hover-follow effects.
- **Scroll-Driven Motion:** Integrated scroll-based transformations (`useScroll`, `useTransform`) for smooth 3D animations.
- **Tailwind-Powered Motion:** Used Tailwind utilities to animate gradients, transitions, and background shifts.
- **Component Scalability:** Followed clean architecture principles with isolated UI sections (Hero, Features, CTA, Footer) and reusable components.
- **Accessibility-Ready Design:** Maintained dark mode contrast and semantic structure while implementing motion and interactivity.
- **Optimized Asset Pipeline:** SVG components handled with `@svgr/webpack`, enabling scalable and color-adaptive icon usage.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Structured for clarity, scalability, and visual separation between UI building blocks.

```bash
onetask/
├── src/
│ ├── app/ # Next.js 14 app directory
│ ├── assets/ # Static images, icons, etc
│ ├── components/ # Reusable UI components (Button, AccordionItem, etc.)
│ └── sections/ # Main sections of the page (Hero, Features, CTA, Footer)
├── .eslintrc.json
├── .prettierrc
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── tailwind.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

Each section represents a visual block from the original Figma layout — implemented with Tailwind utilities and custom CSS variables for subtle animations.

> Fully responsive, and adaptable. Resize your screen to see the responsiveness. 
> Hover effects, gradient reveals, and smooth border masks were all done with Tailwind classes.

## 🧪 Implementation Process

1. **Design Extraction** — Imported layout details (spacing, fonts, gradients) directly from the Figma community file.  
2. **Component Breakdown** — Translated sections (Hero, CTA, Features, Footer) into reusable, isolated React components.  
3. **Tailwind Animation Layer** — Built microinteractions using Tailwind’s transition, transform, and animation utilities.  
4. **Custom Effects** — Created border masks and fade reveals using CSS pseudo-elements and gradients.  
5. **Visual Tweaks** — Adjusted padding, typography, and contrast for aesthetic consistency.  

> Everything from glow effects to section reveals was hand-crafted using Tailwind. Motion was implemented as a tool mainly in the Hero Section as by the utilization of the drag property.

## 🪄 What I Learned

> OneTask deepened my understanding of Motion as library and as a powerful animation tool to create attractive and interactive websites to mantain the user's attention on the website for a longer period of time.
> 
> Creating transitions based solely on TailwindCSS classes allowed for a deeper appreciation and mastery of animations without the need of a third-party package, ultimately reducing the project's packages bloat.
